~~Bubble Sort Using Pass-by-Reference~~

■ Let’s write a bubble sort program using two functions - bubbleSort and swap.

■ Function bubbleSort sorts the array.

■ It calls function swap to exchange the array elements array[j] and array[j + 1]

■ Remember that C enforces information hiding between functions, so swap does not have access
to individual array elements in bubbleSort.

■ Because bubbleSort wants swap to have access to the array elements to be swapped, 
bubbleSort passes each of these elements by reference to swap—the address of each array
element is passed explicitly.
